      "lyrics": "\nThere's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven\nWhen she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed\nWith a word she can get what she came for\nOoh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven\nThere's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure\n'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings\nIn a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings\nSometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven\n\nOoh, makes me wonder\nOoh, makes me wonder\n\nThere's a feeling I get when I look to the west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder\nOoh, really makes me wonder\n\nAnd it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn for those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\n\nOh-oh-oh-oh-whoa\n\nIf there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now\nIt's just a spring clean for the May queen\nYes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run\nThere's still time to change the road you're on\n\nAnd it makes me wonder\nOh, whoa\n\nYour head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know\nThe piper's calling you to join him\nDear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind?\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one and one is all\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven\n"

Let's go!\n\nSteve walks warily down the street\nWith the brim pulled way down low\nAin't no sound but the sound of his feet\nMachine guns ready to go\n\nAre you ready, hey, are you ready for this?\nAre you hanging on the edge of your seat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nHow do you think I'm gonna get along\nWithout you when you're gone?\nYou took me for everything that I had\nAnd kicked me out on my own\n\nAre you happy, are you satisfied?\nHow long can you stand the heat?\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nTo the sound of the beat\n\nLook out!\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nHey!\nOh, take it\nBite the dust\nBite the dust, yeah\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nShout!\n\nThere are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man\nAnd bring him to the ground\nYou can beat him, you can cheat him\nYou can treat him bad and leave him when he's down\n\nBut I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you\nI'm standing on my own two feet\nOut of the doorway the bullets rip\nRepeating to the sound of the beat\n\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnother one bites the dust\nAnd another one gone, and another one gone\nAnother one bites the dust\nHey, I'm gonna get you, too\nAnother one bites the dust\n\nShoot out\nAlright "
